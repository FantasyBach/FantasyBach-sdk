Use browserify to bundle index.js into bundle.js

This sdk is drived from the SDK that comes from AWS API Gateway.  This could be a script:

```
STAGE_ID=kku30n0xzl

echo "If you have problems, ensure this is a valid URL: https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home?region=us-east-1#/restapis/${STAGE_ID}/stages/dev"
echo "Visit https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/download/restapis/${STAGE_ID}/stages/dev/sdks/javascript to download the JS SDK"
```
